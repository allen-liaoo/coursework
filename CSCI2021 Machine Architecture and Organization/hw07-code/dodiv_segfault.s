### dodiv_segfault.s: provides a division function which computes 
### both quotient and remainder.
### 
### This version has a memory problem in it which
### leads to a segmentation fault.
### 
### int dodiv(int numer, int denom, int *quot, int *rem);        
### args:         1:edi      2:esi       3:rdx     4:rcx
