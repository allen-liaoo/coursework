### NOTE: I implemented some tasks differently
I don't have a `/todo/:id` route because I don't think it would look like an "SPA". Instead I used a popup for `/todo/:id` (You can activate it by clicking each info button). I hope that since my solution is a little more challenging than what was expected, that I won't be docked points because of this. Thank you :)
