Write your answers to the questions below directly in this text file to
prepare for the associated quiz. Credit for the HW is earned by
completing the online quiz.


PROBLEM 1 `age.c'
=================

A
~

  Examine the source code for `age.c'. Compile it using the following
  invocation of `gcc'
  ,----
  | gcc age.c
  `----
  This should create the executable `a.out'. Run this program using the
  invocation.
  ,----
  | ./a.out
  `----
  Perform several runs of the program with the following values and
  paste your output in the space below.
  - Enter 16
  You are 8409600 minutes old.
  You're too young to do anything fun.
  - Enter 18
  You are 9460800 minutes old.
  You can vote but cannot legally imbibe alcohol.
  I bet that hasn't stopped you from trying though...
  - Enter 25
  You are 13140000 minutes old.
  You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president
  - Enter 44
  You are 23126400 minutes old.
  You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president


B
~

  Analyze the code for `age.c' and describe a flaw in the conditional
  structure towards the end that prevents the output:
  ,----
  | You can vote, drink, and be president.
  | Try all three at once!
  `----
  from being printed.

  Alter the code to fix this bug so that for ages 35 and larger, the
  above text is printed. Paste your fixed code for the conditional below
  and test it by recompiling and showing a demo run.

  liao0144@csel-atlas:~/hw01-code$ ./a.out
  Enter your age in years: 
  100
  You are 52560000 minutes old.
  You can vote, drink, and be president.
  Try all three at once!


C
~

  Attempt to enter some absurd ages for the age computation.
  - Enter 5000
  - Enter -5000
  Describe anything strange that seems to be happening based your
  understanding of how basic arithmetic is supposed to work.

  It shows that I am -1666967296 minutes old for being 5000 years old. The number should be positive.
  It also shows that I am 1666967296 minutes old for being -500 years old, but the number should be negative.

  If you happen to know WHY this strangeness is happening, describe it
  below.  If not, you will find out soon.

  Integer values in C probably has a range, and when an integer is over or under the range, it overflows and magic happens. 


D
~

  Describe which function is used to print information to the screen.
  Describe how it seems to work to substitute values into output and
  what *format specifier* indicates an integer should be substituted.

  prinf() is used to print info on screen. It substitutes the string "%d" with the integer input.


E
~

  Describe what function is used to read typed input interactively from
  a user in the `age.c' program.  Describe anything that seems strange
  about this function or its arguments.

  We will learn in not long why this bit of strangeness is necessary.

scanf() is used. It probably scans the input string, format the string in the specified way: "%d" (to an integer?), 
and put the value in the age_minutes variable. But I don't know what the symbol & is for.

PROBLEM 2 Collatz
=================

A
~

  Examine and compile the code associated with the collatz
  program. There are three files associated with this program.
  - `collatz_funcs.c' which defines two utility functions for computing
    the Collatz sequence
  - `collatz_main.c' which defines a `main()' function to compute a
    Collatz sequence
  - `collatz.h' header file which declares functions in
    `collatz_funcs.c' so that they are known to `collatz_main.c'

  To compile the program, use the following invocation of `gcc'
  ,----
  | gcc -o collatz collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----
  This should create the program `collatz' which can be run with
  ,----
  | ./collatz
  `----

  Do so and enter inputs
  - Starting integer 7
  - Show output: 1

  Paste the output below.
  Enter the starting integer: 7
  The next value in the Collatz sequence is 22
  Show output of steps (0:NO, any other int: yes): 1
  Step 0: 7
  Step 1: 22
  Step 2: 11
  Step 3: 34
  Step 4: 17
  Step 5: 52
  Step 6: 26
  Step 7: 13
  Step 8: 40
  Step 9: 20
  Step 10: 10
  Step 11: 5
  Step 12: 16
  Step 13: 8
  Step 14: 4
  Step 15: 2
  Step 16: 1
  The starting value 7 converged to 1 in 16 steps

B
~

  Determine what the "dash-O" option used above for `gcc -o' does. For
  example, what happens if one runs
  ,----
  | gcc -o GLIPGLOP collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----

  instead.  You may wish to use the `ls' command to list the files in
  the current directory.

  Describe what happens if you omit this option `-o' when compiling as
  in
  ,----
  | gcc collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----

  It creates an executable with the name specified after "-o ".


C
~

  Attempt to compile only the file `collatz_main.c' by doing
  ,----
  | gcc -o something collatz_main.c
  `----


  This should result in an error. Show the output of that error and
  determine why the compilation fails.

  /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cc1oHevF.o: in function `main':
  collatz_main.c:(.text+0x51): undefined reference to `collatz_next'
  /usr/bin/ld: collatz_main.c:(.text+0xa2): undefined reference to `collatz_steps'
  collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  the functions/methods that are called within collatz_main does not exist within it, 
  and there is no reference to collatz_funcs.c so the compiler doesn't know that it exists.


D
~

  Attempt to compile only the file `collatz_funcs.c' by doing
  ,----
  | gcc -o something collatz_funcs.c
  `----


  This should result in an error. Show the output of that error and
  determine why the compilation fails.

  /usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: in function `_start':
  (.text+0x24): undefined reference to `main'
  collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

  the function main does not exist in collatz_funcs.c, so the compiler cannot create an executale out of it.
