Lab Instructions
================

  Follow the instructions below to experiment with topics related to
  this lab.
  - For sections marked QUIZ, fill in an (X) for the appropriate
    response in this file. Use the command `make test-quiz' to see if
    all of your answers are correct.
  - For sections marked CODE, complete the code indicated. Use the
    command `make test-code' to check if your code is complete.
  - DO NOT CHANGE any parts of this file except the QUIZ sections as it
    may interfere with the tests otherwise.
  - If your `QUESTIONS.txt' file seems corrupted, restore it by copying
    over the `QUESTIONS.txt.bk' backup file.
  - When you complete the exercises, check your answers with `make test'
    and if all is well, create a zip file with `make zip' and upload it
    to Gradescope. Ensure that the Autograder there reflects your local
    results.
  - IF YOU WORK IN A GROUP only one member needs to submit and then add
    the names of their group.


QUIZ Questions UDP Socket Programming
=====================================

  If we want to use 'getaddrinfo()' to obtain either an IPv4 or an IPv6
  address for a server, what value do we use for the 'ai_family' field
  in the 'hints' struct passed to the system call?
  ( ) AF_INET
  ( ) AF_INET6
  ( ) AF_UNSPEC
  ( ) AI_PASSIVE

  If we will be using 'getaddrinfo()' in preparation for using a UDP
  socket, what value do we use for the 'ai_socktype' field in the
  'hints' struct passed to the system call?
  ( ) SOCK_STREAM
  ( ) SOCK_DGRAM
  ( ) SOCK_UDP
  ( ) SOCK_PUPPET

  What is the endianness of all of the CSE Labs machines?
  ( ) Little Endian
  ( ) Big Endian
  ( ) Medium Endian
  ( ) West Endian

  Why do we need to use the 'freeaddrinfo()' function on the struct pointer
  passed as the last argument to 'getaddrinfo()' once we are done using that
  struct in our code?
  ( ) 'getaddrinfo()' opens file descriptors, and 'freeaddrinfo()' will close
      them for us.
  ( ) Trick question: We can really just use 'free()' on this pointer.
  ( ) 'getaddrinfo()' returns a linked list of structs, and 'freeaddrinfo()'
      frees the memory that was allocated for the list
  ( ) This is needed to inform the computer at the address that it will no
      longer receive any connection requests from our code.

CODE Complete udp_client.c
==========================

  Complete the code in 'udp_client.c'. This program is a simple tool for looking
  up the names of various UMN courses by sending a UDP message to a server that
  maintains a repository of course names. It expects two command-line arguments:
    1. The four-letter abbreviated name of the course's department
       (e.g., "CSCI" or "CHEM")
    2. The course's 4-digit number, e.g., 4061 or 1031.

  Your program should set up a UDP socket with the 'getaddrinfo()' and the
  'socket()' system calls. Then, it should send a message to the server
  with the 'sendto()' system call and receive a reply with the 'recvfrom()'
  system call.

  You will need to know the IP address and port of the course name server
  for your call to 'getaddrinfo()'. They are:
    IP Address: 44.199.183.158
    Port: 4061

  You also need to know the data format expected by the server (so it can
  understand your requests) and the format of the data it will send back to your
  process (so you can understand its responses).

  The server expects a request to be a UDP message with the following contents:
    1. Course Department: 5 Bytes representing a null-terminated string of up
       to 4 characters
    2. Course Number: 4 bytes representing an integer value, Little Endian

  The server will send a UDP message in reply with the following contents:
    1. Lookup Status: 4 bytes representing an integer value, Little Endian
    2. Course Name: 128 bytes representing a null-terminated string

  If the server was able to find the course you specified, the 'status' value
  in the response will be 0. Otherwise, it will be -1 if the course was not
  found.

  Hint: Structs are very useful here. You can represent requests and responses
  each as structs and then read and write struct instances to and from your
  socket file descriptor.
