Lab Instructions
================

  Follow the instructions below to experiment with topics related to
  this lab.
  - For sections marked QUIZ, fill in an (X) for the appropriate
    response in this file. Use the command `make test-quiz' to see if
    all of your answers are correct.
  - For sections marked CODE, complete the code indicated. Use the
    command `make test-code' to check if your code is complete.
  - DO NOT CHANGE any parts of this file except the QUIZ sections as it
    may interfere with the tests otherwise.
  - If your `QUESTIONS.txt' file seems corrupted, restore it by copying
    over the `QUESTIONS.txt.bk' backup file.
  - When you complete the exercises, check your answers with `make test'
    and if all is well, create a zip file with `make zip' and upload it
    to Gradescope. Ensure that the Autograder there reflects your local
    results.
  - IF YOU WORK IN A GROUP only one member needs to submit and then add
    the names of their group.


CODE Semaphore-Based Barrier Implementation
============================================

  A barrier is a common primitive in parallel computing. It acts as a point of
  timing synchronization among all of the threads in a group. When a thread
  arrives at a specific point in its code, the "barrier", it must wait until all
  other threads have arrived at that same point as well. Once all threads have
  reached this barrier point, they all may proceed with their execution.

  The most straightforward way to implement a barrier is as a function. Every
  thread calls this function, which blocks the thread until all other threads
  have also called the barrier function. Once every thread has called the
  barrier function, all threads are unblocked.

  Your task is to implement such a barrier function in the file
  'sema_barrier.c'. Begin by studying the code in 'sema_barrier.c' Note that the
  size of the thread group using the barrier is defined as 'N_THREADS' at the
  top of the file.

  The existing code starts N_THREADS additional threads from the initial main
  thread and then waits for all of these threads to complete. Meanwhile,
  the function executed by each thread prints out a message, calls the barrier
  function, and then prints out a second message before terminating.

  Your task is to fill in the missing code in the following locations:
    - At the beginning of 'main()'. Initialize the necessary semaphores here.
    - At the end of 'main()'. Destroy the necessary semaphores here.
    - In the body of 'barrier()'. Use 'sem_wait()' and 'sem_post()' as needed to
      implement the barrier logic described above.

  Note the use of a static variable given to you in the body of 'barrier()'. You
  should use this variable to track the number of threads currently waiting at
  the barrier. Remember, the value of a static variable persists across multiple
  function calls. We saw this earlier in this class in the context of the
  'strtok()' function.

  Hint: You will need *two* semaphores to implement the barrier. One will be a
  binary semaphore used for mutual exclusion, while the other is a counting
  semaphore used to block and unblock threads at the barrier as necessary.


QUIZ Questions 'threads_main' Observations
==========================================

  What should be the initial value of the binary semaphore in your barrier?
  ( ) 0
  ( ) 1
  ( ) N_THREADS
  ( ) None of the Above

  What should be the initial value of the counting semaphore in your barrier?
  ( ) 0
  ( ) 1
  ( ) N_THREADS
  ( ) None of the Above

  Each new thread is given a unique index, and each of these threads prints its
  index to the screen before it arrives at the barrier. What do you observe about
  the order in which these threads run when you run the program multiple times?
  ( ) The threads always get turns in the order in which they were created.
  ( ) The threads always get turns in the reverse order in which they were
      created.
  ( ) The threads don't get turns on the CPU in any particular order.
  ( ) The threads get turns in a random order, but the print order is consistent
      across multiple runs of the program.

  Each thread also prints out its ID after getting through the barrier. What do
  you observe about the order in which threads get to leave the barrier when
  you run the program multiple times?
  ( ) The threads always get to leave the barrier in the order the first ran.
  ( ) The threads always get to leave the barrier in the reverse of the order
      in which they first ran.
  ( ) The threads don't get to leave the barrier in any particular order.
  ( ) The threads get to leave the barrier in a random order, but the order
      is consistent across multiple runs of the program.
